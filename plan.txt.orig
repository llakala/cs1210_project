Fun idea: 
	Mode where you have to write a *working* implementation. It doesn't matter what you type,
	it just has to do what you want.

Title: Typo Trikcery

Our plan is to create a typing game, where the user will be asked to type a given paragraph. They'll be able to see what they type via a live window output, and once they've typed the provided string, they'll be assigned a WPM score. The user will also be able to see their previous WPM scores, and a graph of how their scores have changed over time. 

In terms of modules, I think tkinter, matplotlib, and the time module will likely be enough. 

For testing the program, we can check that the WPM score is accurate, by timing the test ourselves and doing some calculations on what the WPM should look like. We can also do some tests with some realistic data (starting out typing very slowly, then doing a second test at a higher speed) and checking that the graph is accurate.

The graders can likely follow a similar strategy to the one we follow when grading the project. Most of the project comes down to the test functioning, the test results being accurate, and the storage of previous tests also being accurate.
